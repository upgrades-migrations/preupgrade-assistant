Preupgrade Assistant
====================

Preupgrade assistant purpose
----------------------------

Preupgrade assistant performs assessment of the system from
the "upgradeability" point of view. Such analysis includes check for removed
packages, packages replaced by partially incompatible packages, changes in
libraries, users and groups and various services. Report of this analysis
can help the admin with the inplace upgrade - by identification of potential
troubles and by mitigating some of the incompatibilities. Data gathered
by preupgrade assistant can be used for the "cloning" of the system - new,
clean installation of the system, as close as possible to the old RHEL setup.
In addition, it provides some postupgrade scripts which are supposed to finish
migration after the installation of RHEL-7 system.

As the preupgrade assistant doesn't directly modify the assessed system
(except storing information/logs), it is safe to use it on any configuration.
As the contents are not yet complete, successful preupgrade assistant analysis
doesn't necessarily mean that inplace upgrade via rhelup will succeed.

Preupgrade assistant usage
--------------------------

At the moment, only CLI interface and limited functionality is available.

Usage is simple, follow these steps:
1) Run "preupg -l" command - it lists all available contents for
        preupgrade-assistant (as the system is based on plugin, there may be
        modules from different sources in future). If nothing is shown,
        install preupgrade-assistant-contents package.
2) If you have RHEL6_7 content available, run "preupg -s RHEL6_7"
3) Wait until analysis finishes (it can take several minutes)
4) Review the report stored as /root/preupgrade/result.html (and possibly
        files stored at /root/preupgrade) . Especially check for inplace
        upgrade risks (described further in this document)

/root/preupgrade file&directory structure
------------------------------------

This directory contains the data from the last preupgrade assistant run.
Files:
result.html - File with final migration assessment report in human readable
         form (we are sorry for "listing" functionality only)
result.xml - File with final migration assessment report in machine
         readable form
README - this file
results.tar.gz - Tar ball with all files in directory /root/preupgrade

Directories:
cleanconf - directory with all user-modified configuration files, which were
          checked for the compatibility by preupgrade-assistant. These files
          can be safely used on RHEL-7 system (some of these files may need
          postupgrade.d scripts execution)
dirtyconf - directory with all user-modified configuration files, which were not
          checked for the compatibility by preupgrade-assistant. These may
          require admin review after the RHEL-7 installation/upgrade.
kickstart - directory which contains various files useful for generating
          kickstart for cloning this system. Some of the files in this
          directory may give administrator the guidance what was not handled
          by rhelup (and will need some additional actions). See README file
          in the kickstart directory for the file descriptions.
postupgrade.d - contains various scripts which are supposed to be executed
          AFTER the upgrade to RHEL-7. These scripts should NEVER be used
          on RHEL-6 system.
RHEL6_7 - just "debugging" directory - will be removed later. Ignore, unless you'll see some "Error" plugin exit status.

Possible check exit codes explanation
-------------------------------------

Every single plugin has its own exit code. Administrator needs to check
at least those with FAIL result before using inplace upgrade. Results FIXED
should be checked after the inplace upgrade - to finish the RHEL-7 migration
properly.

The possible exit codes are:
 * PASS = everything is fine, no incompatibility/issue detected by this checker
 * FAIL = some incompatibility/issue that needs to be review by admin was detected.
          FAIL doesn't necessarily mean that inplace upgrade will fail, but may
          result in not 100% functional system
 * FIXED = some incompatibility was detected, but preupgrade-assistant was able
          to find automated solution. Some of the fixes may require running
          postupgrade.d scripts after the upgrade. Fixed configs are available
          in /root/preupgrade/cleanconf directory. preupgrade-assistant doesn't
          handle the fixes automatically at the moment!
 * INFORMATIONAL = nice to have information for admins (e.g. removed options
          in some common tools which may cause malfunctions of their scripts)
 * NOT_APPLICABLE = package which should be tested by the check is not
          installed on the system (test therefore doesn't make sense)
 * ERROR = shouldn't occur, does usually mean error in the preupgrade-assistant
          framework. All such errors should be reported to Red Hat
          preupgrade-assistant team.

In place upgrade risk explanations
-----------------------------------

There are several levels of inplace upgrade risks. Any level higher than
"slight" means you will get not 100% functional upgraded system, although
inplace upgrade tool "rhelup" may pass.

The available risk assessment levels are:
 * None - Default. It can be used as an indicator for some checks. It is not
          necessary to enter these values.
 * Slight - We assessed this field and have not found any issues. However,
          there is still some risk that not all variants have been covered.
 * Medium - It is likely that the area causes a problem in case of the inplace
          upgrade. It needs to be checked by the administrator after
          the inplace upgrade and after the system has been monitored for
          some time.
 * High - The inplace upgrade can't be used safely without the administrator's
          assistance. This typically involves some known broken scenario,
          existing 3rd party packages. After the administrator manually fixes
          the issue, it may be possible to perform the inplace upgrade, but it
          is not recommended.
 * Extreme - We found an incompatibility which makes the inplace upgrade
          impossible. It is recommended to install a new system with the help
          of preupgrade-assistant remediations.
